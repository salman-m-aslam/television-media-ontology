- Place tvshows.dtd (DTD), tvshows.owl (ontology), tvshows.xml (XML) and other/tvshowsInferences.owl (empty ontology to save inferences into) in the working directory.
- Execute all the code blocks within the .ipynb file.
- In case of any issue during multiple runs, restart the runtime and run all the code blocks again.

### Results:
- tvshowsUpdatedWithXMLData.owl (Extracted triples)
